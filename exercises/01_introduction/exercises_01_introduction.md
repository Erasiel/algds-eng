# Introduction

### Exercise 1

If you're attending the lab, listen to the introduction by the lab instructor. This will cover administrative details about the course and its completion. If you're reading this at home, read the administrative details of the course on CooSpace, with a specific focus on the course requirements.

### Exercise 2

Open the preview of this Markdown file in your preferred IDE or text editor.

Lab exercises will be shared as Markdown files. Upon first glance, the raw format can be confusing, but most IDEs and advanced text editors have a preview function that shows the rendered, formatted text.

### Exercise 3

Mount your home directory and create a new folder for the Algorithms and Data Structures Practice in it.

All students have passed the Basics of Programming where you used your h-id (`hxxxxxx`) to mount your own working directory.

---

### Exercise 4

Create a Python script in your new directory that prints the string `"Hello World"` 42 times. Execute this script.

In this lab, the programming assignments are going to be in Python. Make sure you can write and execute Python scripts in your preferred editor or IDE.

### Exercise 5

Send the lab instructor an email from your official University of Szeged email address (`hxxxxxx@stud.u-szeged.hu`). You can access your account [here](https://www.stud.u-szeged.hu/horde/).

The email address of the lab instructor is on the whiteboard.

After you're done with this, delete the script you created for Exercise 4.

### Exercise 6

What's wrong with the Python code snippet below? How would you fix it?

```py
def func(a, b, c):
    return a[0] + b[0] * c
```

### Exercise 7

Write Python functions that solve the following tasks:
1. Given three integers, `a`, `b` and `c`, determines if $a \in [b, c]$
2. Given a binary string `s`, replaces all zeros with ones and all ones with zeros.
3. Given a list of integers, where every element of the list is between 0 and 9, finds the most frequent element of the list.
4. Determines the number of unique characters in a string.
5. Calculates the mean of a 2-dimensional matrix of real numbers.

Use the principles discussed in the previous exercise.
